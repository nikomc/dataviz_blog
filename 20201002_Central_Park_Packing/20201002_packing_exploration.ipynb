    "This is a notebook for a ScienceLine data blog. I began this work on October 2, 2020. The central theme, for this blog, is: How many New Yorkers, spread six feet apart, could be stacked into Central Park? It must account for \"empty\" space present when packing circles into squares/rectangles. [See this news item from Science magazine](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2000/03/random-packing-puts-mathematics-box#:~:text=In%201998%2C%20mathematicians%20proved%20that,the%20pile%20is%20empty%20space.) on this subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that _not_ all New Yorkers will be able to fit in Central Park, how high would we have to build to fit them, assuming we are not stacking in three dimensional spheres? What is the average density, in terms of people per area, in the five different boroughs?\n",
